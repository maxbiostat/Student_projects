# Master's projects

For most of the projects outlined here, you are expected to have taken [Probability](https://emap.fgv.br/disciplina/mestrado/probabilidade), [(Mathematical) Statistics](https://emap.fgv.br/disciplina/mestrado/inferencia-estatistica) and [Computational Statistics](https://emap.fgv.br/disciplina/doutorado/estatistica-computacional) by the time you start the project.

A1) **Prevalence estimation and causal inference through regression models with uncertain outcomes**

As the COVID-19 pandemic took the planet by storm, it became apparent the mass testing would be required in order to understand the extent of the virus's spread in the population.
However, as the diagnostic tests are imperfect, the outcome data (Infected/Not-infected) comes with observation error, which must be correctly modelled.
Whilst the general problem of prevalence estimation under outcome uncertainty has been studied for at least four decades, the interface with regression models saw a recent revival, in no small part due to COVID-19 (see [Gelman & Carpenter (2020)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/specificity.pdf)).
There are however many open regression problems, such as for instance re-testing of positive cases, a routine procedure nowadays. 
The student will be expected to implement and extend the models in Section 7.3 of [Bastos, Carvalho & Gomes (2021)](https://github.com/maxbiostat/papers/blob/master/PAPERS/2021_Bastos_Carvalho_Gomes.pdf) using both simulated and real-world data.
