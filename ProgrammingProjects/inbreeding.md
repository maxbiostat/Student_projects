## Efficient estimation of the inbreeding coefficient. 

In this project you'll implement the method in [McClure & Whitlock (2012)](https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201227), in particular equation (8) therein using  [**sumR**](https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira/sumR).
We expect this to be both fast and efficient.
