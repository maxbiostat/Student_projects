## Implementing Phylo2vec in R

You'll port [this](https://github.com/neclow/phylo2vec) Python implementation into R. Specifically, you'll design things to work fast and nice with `phylo` type (**ape**) objects.

The paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12693) if you need a technical resource.
