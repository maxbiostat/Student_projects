## sumPy:  truncating infinite sums in Python

In this project we want to port and expand the functionality of the R package [**sumR**](https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira/sumR) in the Python language.
The idea is to reproduce the structure of the R package, creating wrappers for low-level functions (already implemented in C).
We also want to add features like the ability to handle series that may be negative.

This will be joint work with [Guido Moreira](https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira). You might want to check out [this](https://github.com/wellington36/acceleration_algorithms) project too.
