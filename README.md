# Student projects
A collection of open research projects for those interested in working with me.

Contact: `lmax DOT fgv AT gmail`

**Working environment**: I am a hands off supervisor with a strong focus on fostering independence and scientific curiosity. Expect to be given loads to read and a few 'lectures' on how to do Science properly. I make a point of always being available _via_ email and for pre-booked one-on-one sessions. 

### Undegraduate (Scientific Initiation [IC] and Honours thesis [TCC])

If you're an undergraduate student who (a) likes Statistics and Biology and wants to do Scientific Initiation or (ii) is looking to complete an undergraduate thesis under my supervision but do not have a clear project in mind, there are a few projects listed [**here**](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Student_projects/blob/main/Undergraduate/README.md) that might pique your interest.
These range from programming for Public Health data analysis to theoretical statistics. So pick your poison and shoot me an email.

### Master's degree

A few projects suitable for a MSc Dissertation (in Applied Mathematics) are listed [**here**](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Student_projects/blob/main/MSc/README.md). Feel free to contact me about them, but know that it is probably best to complete coursework before you start the dissertation.
The projects all involve graduate-level Statistics and some involve some non-trivial programming.

### PhD

Now, if you're a prospective PhD student without a project proposal, please take a look at [**this**](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Student_projects/tree/main/PhD) page to see if anything piques your fancy. And then contact me. If you already have an interesting project you think I could supervise, also feel free to shoot me an email.

For PhD-level work I expect a solid theoretical basis, as well as a commitment to the production and maintenance of [Free and open software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and adhrence to the best current practices in [Scientific Reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). I also expect a commitment to the absolute highest standards of scholarship and a drive to contribute to the peer-reviewed international published literature.
