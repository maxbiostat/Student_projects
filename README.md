### Undegraduate (Scientific Initiation [IC] and Honours thesis [TCC])

If you're an undergraduate student who likes Statistics and Biology or you are looking to complete an undergraduate thesis under my supervision but do not have a clear project in mind, there are a few projects listed [here](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Student_projects/blob/main/IC/README.md) that might pique your interest.
These range from programming for Public Health data analysis to theoretical statistics. So pick your poison and shoot me an email.
