# Student projects
A collection of open research projects for those interested in working with me.

### Scientific Initiation projects

If you're an undergraduate student who likes Statistics and Biology, there are a few projects listed [here](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Student_projects/blob/main/IC/IC.md) that might pique your interest.
